Hello, I'm Luna! Your local walking stereotype with an obsession for programming who's on a
never-ending quest to achieve the perfect Linux setup. On this GitHub profile you will find
all the personal projects I've abandoned and hopefully someday a few that I'll actually finish.
You can expect to find anything from web apps to low-level systems. I try it all and I won't stop
until I've acquired all the knowledge.
